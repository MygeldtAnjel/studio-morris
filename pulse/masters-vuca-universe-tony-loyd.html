eyes. When I finally looked at my clock, it was a few minutes before four AM. I had been awake for a while. This wouldn’t be so bad if it weren’t for the fact that I went to bed around midnight last night. To make matters worse, this is the third morning in a row where I awoke after less than four hours of sleep.</p> 
  <p>What’s keeping me awake? It could be one of the dozens of business leader interviews I’ve conducted lately as part of what design thinking experts call “empathy work.” I’m conducting these interviews as a step in the business development of a startup I’m leading. The stories that are pouring out of leaders about business disruption and the rapid rate of change, are hair raising. They are describing to me what the military, particularly the War College, describes as VUCA: Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity and Ambiguity. This describes the modern-day, asymmetrical battle field. Unfortunately, VUCA can also describe the disruptive battlefield of modern-day business. Empathy is the right word for this work. As a fellow business leader, I feel their pain.</p> 
  <p>I also could be awake because, well, like my wife tells me, “You get like that,” especially when I have a big hairy audacious project I’m working on. Not only am I in the midst of starting up a business, I am, in the words of a good friend of mine, “with book.” It’s a little like being “with child,” but slightly different. In the cracks in my brain between thoughts of the business startup, is the idea for a book. No matter how much I try to push this book to the back of my mind, to tell it that now is not the right time or that I don’t have time to pay attention to it, it’s always there. To use a double negative, writing this book is one of those things that I cannot not do.</p> 
  <p>However, the business and the book are not the reasons that I am unable to sleep today. As I crawl out of the bed, finding the dog and leading him into the dark, cool hallway, the thing that has driven me from my bed is much more fundamental than that. It is pain: a deep ache in my left shoulder to be specific. I have had this pain for a few months and it is growing progressively insistent, demanding that I pay attention to it, even at the cost of my sleep.</p> 
  <p>Why haven’t I had it looked at before now? A few years ago I would not have given it a second thought. I would have simply picked up the phone, made the appointment, had any number of diagnostic tests that the doctor ordered and taken the prescribed treatment. I would have done all of this without a single thought about the cost. However, last year, in an attempt to save money, I had opted for the insurance policy with the $6,000 deductible. In November when my shoulder started hurting, it made me think twice, or perhaps three times, before picking up the phone and going to the doctor.</p> 
  <p>I know a little about the healthcare field. I saw some of this disruptive change as the Director of Leadership and Talent Development for a large medical device company. The healthcare field is not what it used to be. Yes, technology has given us breakthrough diagnostics and treatments, however, US healthcare costs have risen <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-05-21/health-care-costs-rise-faster-than-u-s-inflation-rate" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">twice the rate of inflation</a>. . Insurance companies are hesitant to insure our health “at any cost.” And who can blame them? I am aware of the maturity of the US marketplace and the burgeoning middle class in what we recently would have called the emerging markets. “Good enough” technologies, created to provide effective results at low costs in poorer countries are making their way back into the US. I understand the complex, glacial pace of FDA approvals, and how they compare with the pace of approvals in the rest of the world, including Europe. The healthcare field is volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA). It is rife with disruption. And this morning, my shoulder is a casualty in this war.</p> 
  <h2>Welcome to VUCA</h2> 
  <p>We live in a VUCA universe. Does that describe your day-to-day world? Here’s the bad news (as if VUCA itself were not bad enough). The rate of VUCA is speeding up. In his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Leaders-Make-Future-Leadership-Uncertain-ebook/dp/B007QW599C" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>Leaders Make the Future: Ten New Leadership Skills for an Uncertain World,</em></a> Bob Johansen of the <a href="http://iftf.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Institute for the Future</a> tells us:</p> 
  <blockquote>
    What will be new in the years ahead is the scale and intensity of the VUCA World. Having spent forty years forecasting, I believe that the future world will be 
   <em>more</em> volatile, 
   <em>more</em> uncertain, 
   <em>more</em> complex and 
   <em>more</em> ambiguous than we have ever experienced as a planet before. 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The signs are all around us, from a widening gap between rich and poor that threatens the global economy to the increasing oscillation of global climate change. All of this leaves us, with one burning question. How do we, as business leaders, demonstrate leadership mastery in a VUCA world?</p>

  <p>This post is the third of a three-part series on <em>Leading Teams in Times of Transformation</em>. Across these three posts, we’ll explore three questions.</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li><strong>What is the nature of change?</strong> In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nature-change-tony-loyd" target="_blank">the first post</a> in this series, we discussed how transformative change behaves and what it feel like. We saw several examples of VUCA, or in other words, industry-transforming, disruptive change.</li> 
   <li><strong>How do I thrive in times of transformation?</strong> In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-thrive-times-transformation-tony-loyd" target="_blank">the second post in this series</a>, we explored how we as individuals can prepare ourselves to deal with this constant onslaught of change. In a world where we wear "busy" as a badge of honor and treat exhaustion as a status symbol, we need a better way. We discussed how we can do more than simply survive: how we can <em>thrive</em> in the midst of chaos. This was the “put on your own oxygen mask first” bit.</li> 
   <li><strong>How do I lead teams in times of transformation?</strong> Finally, having understood the nature of transformation, and how to care for ourselves, in today’s post we’ll explore a different kind of leadership required for our times. We’ll talk specifically about how to lead teams in times of transformation, or said another way, how do we exhibit leadership mastery in a VUCA world?</li> 
  </ol> 
  <h1>(Another) Reason VUCA is Happening Now</h1> 
  <p>If you read our <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nature-change-tony-loyd" target="_blank">first post in this series</a>, we provided several reasons why VUCA is happening now. Change is exponential, accelerating and compounding. It can be disruptive, which feels like “pow!” Before we jump into the key leadership skills that lead to thriving employees and companies, let’s look at two more reasons why we live in a VUCA world.</p> 
  <h2>A Faster Life Cycle</h2> 
  <p>Whether you are talking about products, markets or organizations, they all go through a life cycle model with at least four phases: start-up, growth, maturity and decline. During the start-up and growth phase change happens quite quickly and revenue increases steadily. However, every product or business eventually matures. Revenues slow and growth ceases. Left unchecked, they eventually begin to decline and eventually become obsolete.</p> 
  <div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"> 
   <img data-media-urn="" data-li-src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQHVihhk4eeUiw/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1520197550339?e=1621468800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=Mbwb6q2f6RGhJHXFXgslIoa89-FAmf_wMiN6u6dzXVo" src="//:0"> 
  </div> 
  <p>For new products, this cycle is happening faster and faster. For example, it took 45 years for home electrification (homes without electricity to receive electricity) to go from 10% of US homes to 90% penetration. However it only took 20 years for cell phones to reach 90% penetration. <a href="http://kk.org/thetechnium/2009/05/increasing-ubiq/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">1</a> Smartphones are being adopted at an even faster rate, going from 10% market penetration to 40% in only 2 1/2 years. <a href="http://www.phonearena.com/news/U.S.-smartphone-adoption-is-faster-than-any-other-major-technology-shift_id30062" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">2</a></p> 
  <p>It used to be true that mature companies with a strong niche in the marketplace were difficult to displace, but that is less true today. Technology has lowered the barrier to entry. Small companies can get big fast. Capital has been democratized via crowdfunding: Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc. The established brand advantage is not as strong as it once was and in some cases can be a disadvantage.</p> 
  <h2>Creative Destruction</h2> 
  <p>The second reason that we are experiencing such rapid change in the marketplace is because of creative destruction.</p> 
  <p>Companies are aware of the life cycle. They understand that, once they have reached a state of market maturity, there is a slowdown in both sales and profits. They are aware that competitive companies and competitive products will eventually displace them in the marketplace. Therefore, they practice what has been called creative destruction or transformation. They take their perfectly good company, product or business model and displace it with a newer, better or cheaper alternative.</p> 
  <div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"> 
   <img data-media-urn="" data-li-src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQFGXM2QjxAsLg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1520214919426?e=1621468800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=kh0bQlXEi_9Jd4O_-hQWuuhPuQomNb19DFGWRLKN5rA" src="//:0"> 
  </div> 
  <p>These two facts, that the life cycle is moving faster and that, and that established brands practice creative destruction, cause massive change in a shorter time period. These trends create a VUCA environment.</p> 
  <h1>What do the Citizens of the VUCA Universe Need?</h1> 
  <p>By now you know that we live in a VUCA universe. We are surrounded by our fellow citizens, people who are undergoing wave after wave of transformational change. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/William-Bridges/e/B000AQ4MUS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">William Bridges</a> is an anthropologist of the VUCA universe. He has been meeting its citizens and mapping out the territory for many years. He knows this universe quite well.</p> 
  <p>According to Bridges, change is what happens to us. It is an external event. At the same time, we begin an internal, psychological journey, which he calls a transition. Initially, we might deny that change is happening at all. After all, we already know the universe we live in. We don’t necessarily want to acknowledge the new reality. We might begin by withdrawing. Or we might carry on with business as usual. Eventually, however, there is an ending, as we realize over a period of time that we must let go.</p> 
  <p>We then move into a neutral zone. We begin to grapple with the change. We might become negative or pessimistic. We begin to turn inward and focus on the impact the change is having on our lives. In the resistance phase of transition, our productivity at work can suffer.</p> 
  <p>After a period of time, we begin to explore our role in the new reality, even if it is with tentative steps. We begin the work of shifting our focus from “me” to “we.” Even though we might be uncertain of the eventual outcome, we begin to experiment with the change. Our energy begins to rise. Though we are uncertain, we begin to explore.</p> 
  <p>Finally, we come to accept the change and we commit ourselves to living in the new reality. Our positive emotions rise. We return to a period of productivity, hopefully at a higher rate than before the change took place.</p>

  <p>Here’s the problem. Change happens fast, but transitions can take time. In a VUCA universe, the waves of change of are coming more and more quickly. It’s like going to the beach on a windy day. If you get knocked down by a wave, another wave may overtake you before you can recover…then another, and another and another. In a VUCA environment, our internal processes, our transitions, might keep us stuck in the neutral zone as wave after wave of change leave us no time for exploration and commitment.</p> 
  <h2>How, Then, Do We Lead?</h2> 
  <p>Given the increasing VUCA nature of our business environment, it is clear that the old command and control competencies will no longer suffice. This requires a different type of leadership. As leaders in a VUCA environment, we need to become masterful at helping our team members to move through transitions quickly. We need to become (fanfare music please) Masters of the VUCA Universe.</p>

  <p>The Foresight to Insight to Action Cycle</p> 
  <p>The Foresight to Insight to Action model above is from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Get-There-Early-Sensing-Compete-ebook/dp/B005M0CZN8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>Get There Early</em></a> by Bob Johansen. It shows how foresight, seeing proactive futures, is a source of vision. This leads to an intuitive journey to insights, sense-making to inspire strategy. This creates clarity. Creating strategies lead to action, the goal of which is to take first mover advantage. This ability to slip quickly into the future space creates corporate agility. Action makes business impact. Hindsight provides perspective on what’s working and not working in the present environment, which informs foresight. All of this activity creates a contextual understanding of our business within the environment.</p> 
  <p>In a VUCA environment, there are eight key competencies that have been shown to be effective, four on an enterprise level and four on a leadership level. They are as follows.</p>

  <p>Let’s look at each of these starting with vision and vulnerability.</p> 
  <h1>Vision and Vulnerability in the face of Volatility</h1> 
  <p>In a volatile business climate, the rate of change can be overwhelming. Our team members want to know that they are OK. In 1999 Roger D’Aprix published <a href="http://www.iabc.com/launching-an-effective-face-to-face-communication-initiative/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>Face-to-Face: Communicating for Leadership</em></a>. Because this document resonated with so many people, it has been borrowed and modified many times over the years. Mr. D’Aprix’s original work proposed that there are six questions that all employees want answered:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>What’s my job?</li> 
   <li>How am I doing?</li> 
   <li>Does anyone care?</li> 
   <li>How is my unit doing?</li> 
   <li>Where are we heading?</li> 
   <li>How can I help?</li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>We know that the first step is to clearly articulate the vision, or as A.G. Lafley and Roger Martin point out in their book <em>Playing to Win: How Strategy Really Works</em>, “What is our winning aspiration?” (See <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/five-strategic-choices-create-sustainable-profitable-growth-tony-loyd" target="_blank">this post</a>.) We begin with the vision and work our way backward. During a time of volatility, this vision becomes even more critical.</p>

  </div> 
  <p>Leading, and setting a clear vision in a volatile environment requires managerial courage, and courage begins with vulnerability. Let’s be honest. For many of us, the last thing that we want to think about, especially in a crisis, is vulnerability. As Krista Tippett of the radio program <a href="http://www.onbeing.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">On Being</a> said <a href="http://www.onbeing.org/program/transcript/4932" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">in a recent interview</a> with researcher Brené Brown,</p> 
  <blockquote>
    So vulnerability is this other word you use a lot that our culture is almost allergic to. 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>We sometimes equate the word vulnerability with words like gullibility, weakness, naiveté or danger. Nothing could be further from the truth. Vulnerability comes from a place of strength. As Brené Brown has said,</p> 
  <blockquote>
    Vulnerability, I think, you know, when I ask people what is vulnerability, the answers were things like sitting with my wife who has Stage III breast cancer and trying to make plans for our children, my first date after my divorce, saying I love you first, asking for a raise, sending my child to school being enthusiastic and supportive of him and knowing how excited he is about orchestra tryouts and how much he wants to make first chair and encouraging him and supporting him and knowing that's not going to happen. To me, 
   <strong>vulnerability is courage</strong>. It's about the willingness to show up and be seen in our lives. And in those moments when we show up, I think those are the most powerful meaning-making moments of our lives even if they don't go well. I think they define who we are 
   <strong>… I can tell you as a researcher, 11,000 pieces of data, I cannot find a single example of courage, moral courage, spiritual courage, leadership courage, relational courage, I cannot find a single example of courage in my research that was not born completely of vulnerability.</strong> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>If we are going to lead when things are tough; if we are going to lead in a volatile business environment, we are going to need all of the courage we can muster. This requires that we put ourselves out there; that we are vulnerable.</p> 
  <p>(If you don’t know Brené Brown, it is definitely worth your time to become familiar with her work.

  <h1>Understanding and Unflinching Grit in the face of Uncertainty</h1> 
  <p>When the business environment is filled with uncertainty, team members and leaders try to gain understanding. Remember the Foresight to Insight to Action model above? Understanding comes from an unflinching grit and decision making in the face of uncertainty.</p> 
  <p>I recently spoke with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/james-killian-ph-d/0/182/859/en" target="_blank">James Killian</a>, an expert on leadership competencies and a contributing author of <a href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/books.htm?issn=1535-1203&amp;volume=6&amp;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>Advances in Global Leadership</em></a>. We generally discussed how the right leadership competencies differ based on role in the company and the maturity level on the life cycle. However, when we started talking about competencies for a VUCA environment, James’ voice took on a tone of urgency.</p> 
  <blockquote>
    Look, leading in this environment takes a different set of skills. Yes, the things I’ve written about in the past are important, but today, I’m beginning to think of them as table stakes. In a VUCA environment you have to add to this competencies like Agility, Adaptability and Grit, you know mental toughness. 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>On the topic of unflinching grit in the face of uncertainty, James emphasized decision making skills, but not just speed and accuracy of decisions, which are still important. He also talked about the ability to hold two opposing thoughts in one’s head at once. In his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Leaders-Make-Future-Leadership-Uncertain-ebook/dp/B007QW599C" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>Leaders Make the Future,</em></a> Bob Johansen calls this “dilemma flipping” or the ability to turn dilemmas, which unlike problems cannot be solved, into advantages and opportunities. Johansen also describes “constructive depolarizing” or the ability to calm tense situations where differences dominate and communication has broken down, and bring people from divergent cultures toward constructive engagement. This is the unflinching grit that James Killian described.</p> 
  <p>If we are going to create insights and understanding about the business environment, we’re going to have to become comfortable with paradoxes. And if we’re going to make solid decisions in the face of uncertainty, we’re going to need to bring our leadership team along with us through controversial decisions. This requires mental toughness or, as we’ve named it here, unflinching grit.</p> 
  <h1>Clarity and Curiosity in the face of Complexity</h1> 
  <p>When we are working in a complex business environment, team members look to us to create clarity. And clarity comes from an insatiable sense of curiosity about what is.</p> 
  <p>It is important that we point out that there is a major difference between clarity and certainty. If we’re honest with ourselves, we all want to be certain that the business decisions that we’re making are the right ones. We want it. Our boards want it and our employees certainly want it. We want certainty that every project will have a high return on investment. Every product is a roaring success. Every risk we take pays off. Wouldn’t that be wonderful? But that’s not the world we live in, is it?</p> 
  <p>It is human nature to seek certainty, but in business, very little is certain. However, if we look boldly into the future with foresight and maintain a sense of curiosity about the insights to our business, we can create a sense of clarity about what to do next.</p> 
  <h1>Agility and Authenticity in the face of Ambiguity</h1> 
  <p>I was not a bad typist…you know, on a typewriter. Remember those? And yet, one Saturday in 1989 I found myself snapping together a PC from components purchased from several different sources. That day I learned how to assemble a PC, format a hard drive, install software and how to use several DOS commands, I also learned how to use a word processing software program called Pfs:Write. This pre-dated Microsoft Word or Corel’s WordPerfect before that. At the time, those were all cutting edge skills.</p> 
  <p>How many of those skills do you think I use today? It has been several years since I last had to type a DOS command. The very idea of “software” is going away and being replaced by cloud solutions and Software as a Service or SaaS. And the tower case of the PC that I built on that Saturday could probably hold a couple dozen of the tablets and phablets that I have in my home today. Yet, this experience taught me many things. All of the skills learned that day were perfectly transferrable, including the knowledge that I was a somewhat capable human being. This ability, to be in a stressful situation, extract the lessons learned and apply those lessons to new situations, is often referred to as Learning Agility.</p> 
  <p>A few years ago, while working for a Fortune 500 company, we found that learning agility was a great predictor of success for business leaders in emerging markets. This make sense, doesn’t it? If your economy is growing at breakneck speed if your political environment is unstable and your currency fluctuates violently, you’ve better be good at learning agility. However, over a period of time, we found that over a period of time, learning agility became more of a predictor of success for business leaders in “mature” markets. The rate of transformational change was no longer limited to emerging markets. VUCA had become a global reality.</p> 
  <p>In a VUCA environment, skills have a shorter shelf life. If you go to a university and earn a marketing degree, the skills you learn in your freshman year may need to be refreshed several times by the time you graduate. New skills are always entering the marketplace and older skills are expiring. If we are going to be successful in a VUCA environment, we have to be agile in our ability to learn.</p> 
  <p>For more on learning agility, there are many articles that are only a Google search away. In fact, there are almost too many articles, some of which are of dubious quality. For a thorough treatment of learning agility, I would point you to research by <a href="http://www.bersin.com/Lexicon/Details.aspx?id=14906" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Bersin by Deloitte</a>, or for a thorough academic treatment, <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~cgmyers/iop2012_learningagility.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">to this article</a>.</p> 
  <p>It’s not just the individuals in our companies that must be agile in a VUCA business environment. Organizations also have to be agile. As we stated earlier, the life cycle of products is becoming shorter. The barrier to entrance is lower than ever for new products and new competitors. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Innovation-Successful-Businesses-ebook/dp/B004J4XGN6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Learn Startup</a> techniques and rapid prototyping have shortened the time to produce a minimally viable product. If you are not practicing these same techniques within your established companies, it is only a matter of time before your competition overtakes you.</p> 
  <h2>Why Authenticity is so important in an Ambiguous Business Environment</h2> 
  <p>Before we leave this topic of leading in an ambiguous business environment, let’s talk about the kinds of leaders that win in this marketplace. I believe that, of all of the competencies that we have discussed so far, authenticity is the killer app.</p> 
  <p>In my role with a large retail organization, I had access to some of the latest consumer trends. When one looks at these trends, certain words come up again and again: local, hand-crafted, real, and authentic. Deloitte saw the same sort of trends last year when they looked at <a href="http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-Argentina/Local%20Assets/Documents/consultoria/human_capital/arg_hc_global-human-capital-trends-2014_09062014.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Global Human Capital Trends</a>. Words like meaning and purpose took center stage? So, what’s going on?</p> 
  <p>Researcher and author Aaron Hurst calls it <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Purpose-Economy-Personal-Community-Changing-ebook/dp/B00JEMUB1S" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The Purpose Economy</a></em>. According to Hurst,</p> 
  <blockquote>
    …it had become clear to me that a new economy was emerging, one centered on the need for individuals to find purpose in their work and lives…This shift is so substantial and pervasive that I now believe we are in the early days of the emergence of a ‘Purpose Economy’ – the fourth American economy in our history. 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Yes, something is happening here. Gen X and Gen Y are disillusion with the old career paths that for them were nothing more than a dead end. Boomers have worked long enough to have lots of choices. The only question for them now is, what do we want to do with the time remaining in our careers? Can we make an impact? With the corporate blood-letting of the economic downturn, these questions did not become important. For many, how we show up as real humans in the workplace and do work that makes a difference, well, these are the ONLY questions. As a colleague of mine recently said, “In the massive bloodletting of the 2008 – 2012, we saw a flight to authenticity.”</p> 
  <p>In an email exchange with a recruiter in the financial services industry, the recruiter told me:</p> 
  <blockquote>
    People don't move careers for the same reasons they once did. 10 years ago recruiting was about the money. The phone calls were quick and to the point "If I can pay you more money - will you come work here?" 9/10 times the answer was yes. Now recruiting is about positioning yourself as a brand with stability and longevity and community/social awareness. It's about what a company is doing more than what the job is or what it pays. 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>These employees want to connect with an authentic leader. And the more ambiguous the business environment, the more critical authenticity becomes.</p> 
  <h1>Masters of the VUCA Universe</h1> 
  <p>As we wrap up this three part series on Leading Teams in Times of Transformation, let’s revisit our three questions.</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li><strong>What is the nature of change</strong>? We’ve discovered that, while change is natural and happening all of the time, the problem is that change is accelerating at an exponential rate. Multiple change channels can come together, creating a compounding effect. Eventually, the forces of change create a quantum leap. Pow! When mere change becomes VUCA, we need new ways of being and leading.</li> 
   <li><strong>How do I thrive in times of transformation</strong>? As individuals can prepare ourselves to deal with this constant onslaught of change. In a world where we wear "busy" as a badge of honor and treat exhaustion as a status symbol, we need a better way. We discussed how we can do more than simply survive: how we can thrive in the midst of chaos. This was the “put on your own oxygen mask first” bit.</li> 
   <li><strong>How do I lead teams in times of transformation</strong>? Finally, having understood the nature of transformation, and how to care for ourselves, in today’s post we described eight key competencies required for our times. These eight competencies lead to mastery when leading in a VUCA environment.</li>

When I finally looked at my clock, it was a few minutes before four AM. I had been awake for a while. This wouldn’t be so bad if it weren’t for the fact that I went to bed around midnight last night. To make matters worse, this is the third morning in a row where I awoke after less than four hours of sleep.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eWhat’s keeping me awake? It could be one of the dozens of business leader interviews I’ve conducted lately as part of what design thinking experts call “empathy work.” I’m conducting these interviews as a step in the business development of a startup I’m leading. The stories that are pouring out of leaders about business disruption and the rapid rate of change, are hair raising. They are describing to me what the military, particularly the War College, describes as VUCA: Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity and Ambiguity. This describes the modern-day, asymmetrical battle field. Unfortunately, VUCA can also describe the disruptive battlefield of modern-day business. Empathy is the right word for this work. As a fellow business leader, I feel their pain.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eI also could be awake because, well, like my wife tells me, “You get like that,” especially when I have a big hairy audacious project I’m working on. Not only am I in the midst of starting up a business, I am, in the words of a good friend of mine, “with book.” It’s a little like being “with child,” but slightly different. In the cracks in my brain between thoughts of the business startup, is the idea for a book. No matter how much I try to push this book to the back of my mind, to tell it that now is not the right time or that I don’t have time to pay attention to it, it’s always there. To use a double negative, writing this book is one of those things that I cannot not do.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eHowever, the business and the book are not the reasons that I am unable to sleep today. As I crawl out of the bed, finding the dog and leading him into the dark, cool hallway, the thing that has driven me from my bed is much more fundamental than that. It is pain: a deep ache in my left shoulder to be specific. I have had this pain for a few months and it is growing progressively insistent, demanding that I pay attention to it, even at the cost of my sleep.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eWhy haven’t I had it looked at before now? A few years ago I would not have given it a second thought. I would have simply picked up the phone, made the appointment, had any number of diagnostic tests that the doctor ordered and taken the prescribed treatment. I would have done all of this without a single thought about the cost. However, last year, in an attempt to save money, I had opted for the insurance policy with the $6,000 deductible. In November when my shoulder started hurting, it made me think twice, or perhaps three times, before picking up the phone and going to the doctor.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eI know a little about the healthcare field. I saw some of this disruptive change as the Director of Leadership and Talent Development for a large medical device company. The healthcare field is not what it used to be. Yes, technology has given us breakthrough diagnostics and treatments, however, US healthcare costs have risen \u003ca href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-05-21/health-care-costs-rise-faster-than-u-s-inflation-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003etwice the rate of inflation\u003c/a\u003e. . Insurance companies are hesitant to insure our health “at any cost.” And who can blame them? I am aware of the maturity of the US marketplace and the burgeoning middle class in what we recently would have called the emerging markets. “Good enough” technologies, created to provide effective results at low costs in poorer countries are making their way back into the US. I understand the complex, glacial pace of FDA approvals, and how they compare with the pace of approvals in the rest of the world, including Europe. The healthcare field is volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA). It is rife with disruption. And this morning, my shoulder is a casualty in this war.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003ch2\u003eWelcome to VUCA\u003c/h2\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eWe live in a VUCA universe.

Change is exponential, accelerating and compounding. It can be disruptive, which feels like “pow!” Before we jump into the key leadership skills that lead to thriving employees and companies, let’s look at two more reasons why we live in a VUCA world.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003ch2\u003eA Faster Life Cycle\u003c/h2\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eWhether you are talking about products, markets or organizations, they all go through a life cycle model with at least four phases: start-up, growth, maturity and decline. During the start-up and growth phase change happens quite quickly and revenue increases steadily. However, every product or business eventually matures. Revenues slow and growth ceases. Left unchecked, they eventually begin to decline and eventually become obsolete.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cdiv class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"\u003e \n   \u003cimg data-media-urn=\"\" data-li-src=\"https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQHVihhk4eeUiw/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1520197550339?e=1621468800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=Mbwb6q2f6RGhJHXFXgslIoa89-FAmf_wMiN6u6dzXVo\" src=\"//:0\"\u003e \n  \u003c/div\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eFor new products, this cycle is happening faster and faster. For example, it took 45 years for home electrification (homes without electricity to receive electricity) to go from 10% of US homes to 90% penetration. However it only took 20 years for cell phones to reach 90% penetration. \u003ca href=\"http://kk.org/thetechnium/2009/05/increasing-ubiq/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e1\u003c/a\u003e Smartphones are being adopted at an even faster rate, going from 10% market penetration to 40% in only 2 1/2 years. \u003ca href=\"http://www.phonearena.com/news/U.S.-smartphone-adoption-is-faster-than-any-other-major-technology-shift_id30062\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e2\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eIt used to be true that mature companies with a strong niche in the marketplace were difficult to displace, but that is less true today. Technology has lowered the barrier to entry. Small companies can get big fast. Capital has been democratized via crowdfunding: Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc. The established brand advantage is not as strong as it once was and in some cases can be a disadvantage.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003ch2\u003eCreative Destruction\u003c/h2\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eThe second reason that we are experiencing such rapid change in the marketplace is because of creative destruction.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eCompanies are aware of the life cycle. They understand that, once they have reached a state of market maturity, there is a slowdown in both sales and profits. They are aware that competitive companies and competitive products will eventually displace them in the marketplace. Therefore, they practice what has been called creative destruction or transformation. They take their perfectly good company, product or business model and displace it with a newer, better or cheaper alternative.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cdiv class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"\u003e \n   \u003cimg data-media-urn=\"\" data-li-src=\"https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQFGXM2QjxAsLg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1520214919426?e=1621468800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=kh0bQlXEi_9Jd4O_-hQWuuhPuQomNb19DFGWRLKN5rA\" src=\"//:0\"\u003e \n  \u003c/div\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eThese two facts, that the life cycle is moving faster and that, and that established brands practice creative destruction, cause massive change in a shorter time period. These trends create a VUCA environment.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003ch1\u003eWhat do the Citizens of the VUCA Universe Need?\u003c/h1\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eBy now you know that we live in a VUCA universe. We are surrounded by our fellow citizens, people who are undergoing wave after wave of transformational change. \u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/William-Bridges/e/B000AQ4MUS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eWilliam Bridges\u003c/a\u003e is an anthropologist of the VUCA universe. He has been meeting its citizens and mapping out the territory for many years. He knows this universe quite well.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eAccording to Bridges, change is what happens to us. It is an external event. At the same time, we begin an internal, psychological journey, which he calls a transition. Initially, we might deny that change is happening at all. After all, we already know the universe we live in. We don’t necessarily want to acknowledge the new reality. We might begin by withdrawing. Or we might carry on with business as usual. Eventually, however, there is an ending, as we realize over a period of time that we must let go.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eWe then move into a neutral zone. We begin to grapple with the change. We might become negative or pessimistic. We begin to turn inward and focus on the impact the change is having on our lives. In the resistance phase of transition, our productivity at work can suffer.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eAfter a period of time, we begin to explore our role in the new reality, even if it is with tentative steps. We begin the work of shifting our focus from “me” to “we.” Even though we might be uncertain of the eventual outcome, we begin to experiment with the change. Our energy begins to rise. Though we are uncertain, we begin to explore.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eFinally, we come to accept the change and we commit ourselves to living in the new reality. Our positive emotions rise. We return to a period of productivity, hopefully at a higher rate than before the change took place.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cdiv class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"\u003e \n   \u003cimg data-media-urn=\"\" data-li-src=\"https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQERKWvtfICHdg/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520233362006?e=1621468800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=SPmQA5LH3cqs8qJ-PnDUNPXyi_jNe1IdVHX6ILLBswU\" src=\"//:0\"\u003e \n  \u003c/div\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Managing-Transitions-Making-Most-Change-ebook/dp/B001FYY8SU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eManaging Transitions: Making the Most of Change\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e by William Bridges\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eHere’s the problem. Change happens fast, but transitions can take time. In a VUCA universe, the waves of change of are coming more and more quickly. It’s like going to the beach on a windy day. If you get knocked down by a wave, another wave may overtake you before you can recover…then another, and another and another.

It shows how foresight, seeing proactive futures, is a source of vision. This leads to an intuitive journey to insights, sense-making to inspire strategy. This creates clarity. Creating strategies lead to action, the goal of which is to take first mover advantage. This ability to slip quickly into the future space creates corporate agility. Action makes business impact.

Our team members want to know that they are OK. In 1999 Roger D’Aprix published \u003ca href=\"http://www.iabc.com/launching-an-effective-face-to-face-communication-initiative/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFace-to-Face: Communicating for Leadership\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. Because this document resonated with so many people, it has been borrowed and modified many times over the years. Mr. D’Aprix’s original work proposed that there are six questions that all employees want answered:\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003col\u003e \n   \u003cli\u003eWhat’s my job?\u003c/li\u003e \n   \u003cli\u003eHow am I doing?\u003c/li\u003e \n   \u003cli\u003eDoes anyone care?\u003c/li\u003e \n   \u003cli\u003eHow is my unit doing?\u003c/li\u003e \n   \u003cli\u003eWhere are we heading?\u003c/li\u003e \n   \u003cli\u003eHow can I help?\u003c/li\u003e \n  \u003c/ol\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eWe know that the first step is to clearly articulate the vision, or as A.G. Lafley and Roger Martin point out in their book \u003cem\u003ePlaying to Win: How Strategy Really Works\u003c/em\u003e, “What is our winning aspiration?” (See \u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/five-strategic-choices-create-sustainable-profitable-growth-tony-loyd\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis post\u003c/a\u003e.) We begin with the vision and work our way backward.

Let’s be honest. For many of us, the last thing that we want to think about, especially in a crisis, is vulnerability. As Krista Tippett of the radio program \u003ca href=\"http://www.onbeing.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eOn Being\u003c/a\u003e said \u003ca href=\"http://www.onbeing.org/program/transcript/4932\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ein a recent interview\u003c/a\u003e with researcher Brené Brown,\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cblockquote\u003e\n    So vulnerability is this other word you use a lot that our culture is almost allergic to. \n  \u003c/blockquote\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eWe sometimes equate the word vulnerability with words like gullibility, weakness, naiveté or danger. Nothing could be further from the truth. Vulnerability comes from a place of strength. As Brené Brown has said,\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cblockquote\u003e\n    Vulnerability, I think, you know, when I ask people what is vulnerability, the answers were things like sitting with my wife who has Stage III breast cancer and trying to make plans for our children, my first date after my divorce, saying I love you first, asking for a raise, sending my child to school being enthusiastic and supportive of him and knowing how excited he is about orchestra tryouts and how much he wants to make first chair and encouraging him and supporting him and knowing that's not going to happen. To me, \n   \u003cstrong\u003evulnerability is courage\u003c/strong\u003e. It's about the willingness to show up and be seen in our lives. And in those moments when we show up, I think those are the most powerful meaning-making moments of our lives even if they don't go well. I think they define who we are \n   \u003cstrong\u003e… I can tell you as a researcher, 11,000 pieces of data, I cannot find a single example of courage, moral courage, spiritual courage, leadership courage, relational courage, I cannot find a single example of courage in my research that was not born completely of vulnerability.\u003c/strong\u003e \n  \u003c/blockquote\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eIf we are going to lead when things are tough; if we are going to lead in a volatile business environment, we are going to need all of the courage we can muster. This requires that we put ourselves out there; that we are vulnerable.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003e(If you don’t know Brené Brown, it is definitely worth your time to become familiar with her work.

Remember the Foresight to Insight to Action model above? Understanding comes from an unflinching grit and decision making in the face of uncertainty.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eI recently spoke with \u003ca href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/james-killian-ph-d/0/182/859/en\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJames Killian\u003c/a\u003e, an expert on leadership competencies and a contributing author of \u003ca href=\"http://www.emeraldinsight.com/books.htm?issn=1535-1203&amp;volume=6&amp;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eAdvances in Global Leadership\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. We generally discussed how the right leadership competencies differ based on role in the company and the maturity level on the life cycle. However, when we started talking about competencies for a VUCA environment, James’ voice took on a tone of urgency.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cblockquote\u003e\n    Look, leading in this environment takes a different set of skills. Yes, the things I’ve written about in the past are important, but today, I’m beginning to think of them as table stakes. In a VUCA environment you have to add to this competencies like Agility, Adaptability and Grit, you know mental toughness. \n  \u003c/blockquote\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eOn the topic of unflinching grit in the face of uncertainty, James emphasized decision making skills, but not just speed and accuracy of decisions, which are still important. He also talked about the ability to hold two opposing thoughts in one’s head at once. In his book \u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Leaders-Make-Future-Leadership-Uncertain-ebook/dp/B007QW599C\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eLeaders Make the Future,\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e Bob Johansen calls this “dilemma flipping” or the ability to turn dilemmas, which unlike problems cannot be solved, into advantages and opportunities. Johansen also describes “constructive depolarizing” or the ability to calm tense situations where differences dominate and communication has broken down, and bring people from divergent cultures toward constructive engagement. This is the unflinching grit that James Killian described.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eIf we are going to create insights and understanding about the business environment, we’re going to have to become comfortable with paradoxes. And if we’re going to make solid decisions in the face of uncertainty, we’re going to need to bring our leadership team along with us through controversial decisions. This requires mental toughness or, as we’ve named it here, unflinching grit.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003ch1\u003eClarity and Curiosity in the face of Complexity\u003c/h1\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eWhen we are working in a complex business environment, team members look to us to create clarity. And clarity comes from an insatiable sense of curiosity about what is.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eIt is important that we point out that there is a major difference between clarity and certainty. If we’re honest with ourselves, we all want to be certain that the business decisions that we’re making are the right ones. We want it. Our boards want it and our employees certainly want it. We want certainty that every project will have a high return on investment. Every product is a roaring success. Every risk we take pays off. Wouldn’t that be wonderful? But that’s not the world we live in, is it?\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eIt is human nature to seek certainty, but in business, very little is certain. However, if we look boldly into the future with foresight and maintain a sense of curiosity about the insights to our business, we can create a sense of clarity about what to do next.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003ch1\u003eAgility and Authenticity in the face of Ambiguity\u003c/h1\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eI was not a bad typist…you know, on a typewriter. Remember those? And yet, one Saturday in 1989 I found myself snapping together a PC from components purchased from several different sources. That day I learned how to assemble a PC, format a hard drive, install software and how to use several DOS commands, I also learned how to use a word processing software program called Pfs:Write. This pre-dated Microsoft Word or Corel’s WordPerfect before that. At the time, those were all cutting edge skills.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eHow many of those skills do you think I use today? It has been several years since I last had to type a DOS command. The very idea of “software” is going away and being replaced by cloud solutions and Software as a Service or SaaS. And the tower case of the PC that I built on that Saturday could probably hold a couple dozen of the tablets and phablets that I have in my home today. Yet, this experience taught me many things. All of the skills learned that day were perfectly transferrable, including the knowledge that I was a somewhat capable human being. This ability, to be in a stressful situation, extract the lessons learned and apply those lessons to new situations, is often referred to as Learning Agility.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eA few years ago, while working for a Fortune 500 company, we found that learning agility was a great predictor of success for business leaders in emerging markets. This make sense, doesn’t it? If your economy is growing at breakneck speed if your political environment is unstable and your currency fluctuates violently, you’ve better be good at learning agility. However, over a period of time, we found that over a period of time, learning agility became more of a predictor of success for business leaders in “mature” markets. The rate of transformational change was no longer limited to emerging markets. VUCA had become a global reality.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eIn a VUCA environment, skills have a shorter shelf life. If you go to a university and earn a marketing degree, the skills you learn in your freshman year may need to be refreshed several times by the time you graduate. New skills are always entering the marketplace and older skills are expiring. If we are going to be successful in a VUCA environment, we have to be agile in our ability to learn.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eFor more on learning agility, there are many articles that are only a Google search away. In fact, there are almost too many articles, some of which are of dubious quality. For a thorough treatment of learning agility, I would point you to research by \u003ca href=\"http://www.bersin.com/Lexicon/Details.aspx?id=14906\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eBersin by Deloitte\u003c/a\u003e, or for a thorough academic treatment, \u003ca href=\"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~cgmyers/iop2012_learningagility.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eto this article\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eIt’s not just the individuals in our companies that must be agile in a VUCA business environment. Organizations also have to be agile. As we stated earlier, the life cycle of products is becoming shorter. The barrier to entrance is lower than ever for new products and new competitors. \u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Innovation-Successful-Businesses-ebook/dp/B004J4XGN6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eLearn Startup\u003c/a\u003e techniques and rapid prototyping have shortened the time to produce a minimally viable product.

I believe that, of all of the competencies that we have discussed so far, authenticity is the killer app.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eIn my role with a large retail organization, I had access to some of the latest consumer trends. When one looks at these trends, certain words come up again and again: local, hand-crafted, real, and authentic. Deloitte saw the same sort of trends last year when they looked at \u003ca href=\"http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-Argentina/Local%20Assets/Documents/consultoria/human_capital/arg_hc_global-human-capital-trends-2014_09062014.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eGlobal Human Capital Trends\u003c/a\u003e. Words like meaning and purpose took center stage? So, what’s going on?\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eResearcher and author Aaron Hurst calls it \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Purpose-Economy-Personal-Community-Changing-ebook/dp/B00JEMUB1S\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eThe Purpose Economy\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. According to Hurst,\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cblockquote\u003e\n    …it had become clear to me that a new economy was emerging, one centered on the need for individuals to find purpose in their work and lives…This shift is so substantial and pervasive that I now believe we are in the early days of the emergence of a ‘Purpose Economy’ – the fourth American economy in our history. \n  \u003c/blockquote\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eYes, something is happening here. Gen X and Gen Y are disillusion with the old career paths that for them were nothing more than a dead end. Boomers have worked long enough to have lots of choices. The only question for them now is, what do we want to do with the time remaining in our careers? Can we make an impact? With the corporate blood-letting of the economic downturn, these questions did not become important. For many, how we show up as real humans in the workplace and do work that makes a difference, well, these are the ONLY questions. As a colleague of mine recently said, “In the massive bloodletting of the 2008 – 2012, we saw a flight to authenticity.”\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eIn an email exchange with a recruiter in the financial services industry, the recruiter told me:\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003cblockquote\u003e\n    People don't move careers for the same reasons they once did. 10 years ago recruiting was about the money. The phone calls were quick and to the point \"If I can pay you more money - will you come work here?\" 9/10 times the answer was yes. Now recruiting is about positioning yourself as a brand with stability and longevity and community/social awareness. It's about what a company is doing more than what the job is or what it pays. \n  \u003c/blockquote\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eThese employees want to connect with an authentic leader. And the more ambiguous the business environment, the more critical authenticity becomes.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003ch1\u003eMasters of the VUCA Universe\u003c/h1\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003eAs we wrap up this three part series on Leading Teams in Times of Transformation, let’s revisit our three questions.\u003c/p\u003e \n  \u003col\u003e \n   \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the nature of change\u003c/strong\u003e? We’ve discovered that, while change is natural and happening all of the time, the problem is that change is accelerating at an exponential rate. Multiple change channels can come together, creating a compounding effect. Eventually, the forces of change create a quantum leap. Pow!

In a world where we wear \"busy\" as a badge of honor and treat exhaustion as a status symbol, we need a better way. We discussed how we can do more than simply survive: how we can thrive in the midst of chaos.
